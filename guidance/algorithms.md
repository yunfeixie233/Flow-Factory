## Overview

Flow-Factory provides unified implementations of state-of-the-art RL algorithms for flow-matching models. All algorithms share the same model adapter and reward interfaces, enabling direct comparison under controlled conditions.

At a high level, the supported algorithms fall into two paradigms:

- **Coupled paradigm (GRPO and variants)**: Training timesteps are coupled with the SDE-based sampling dynamics, requiring tractable log-probability computation for policy gradient optimization.
- **Decoupled paradigm (DPO, DiffusionNFT, AWM, DGPO, CRD, DiffusionOPD)**: Training timesteps are decoupled from the actual sampling dynamics, making them inherently solver-agnostic — any ODE solver can be used for trajectory generation without modifying the training procedure.

## GRPO

### Background

GRPO has achieved significant success in Flow Matching models. In contrast to the standard deterministic ODE-style update rule:

$$
x_{t+\mathrm{d}t} = x_{t} + v_{\theta}(x_t, t) \mathrm{d}t
$$

References [[1]](#ref1) and [[2]](#ref2) incorporate noise to facilitate RL exploration, proposing the following SDE-based update rule:

$$
x_{t+\mathrm{d}t} = x_{t} + [v_{\theta}(x_t, t) + \frac{\sigma_{t}^{2}}{2t}(x_t + (1-t)v_{\theta}(x_t, t))]\mathrm{d}t + \sigma_{t} \sqrt{\mathrm{d}t} \epsilon
$$

where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and $\sigma_t$ denotes the noise schedule. This SDE formulation enables the log-probability computation required for policy gradient optimization.

The formulation of $\sigma_t$ differs between methods: it is defined as $\eta\sqrt{\frac{t}{1-t}}$ in Flow-GRPO [[1]](#ref1) and as $\eta$ in DanceGRPO [[2]](#ref2), where $\eta \in [0,1]$ is a hyperparameter controlling the noise level. See the [Dynamics Type](#dynamics-type) section for a complete summary.

This algorithm is implemented as `grpo`. To use this algorithm, set config with:

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: grpo
```

### Dynamics Type

Flow-Factory implements multiple SDE dynamics through a unified `SDESchedulerMixin` interface. Users can switch between formulations via a single configuration parameter, facilitating systematic comparison of their effects on training stability and sample quality.

| Dynamics   | Noise Schedule $\sigma_t$              | Reference                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `Flow-SDE` | $\eta\sqrt{t/(1-t)}$                 | Flow-GRPO [[1]](#ref1)       |
| `Dance-SDE`| $\eta$ (constant)                     | DanceGRPO [[2]](#ref2)       |
| `CPS`      | $\sigma_{t-1}\sin(\eta\pi/2)$        | FlowCPS [[9]](#ref9)         |
| `ODE`      | $0$ (deterministic)                   | For NFT [[7]](#ref7) / DGPO [[8]](#ref8) / AWM [[10]](#ref10) |

To switch between these formulations, set:

```yaml
scheduler:
    dynamics_type: 'Flow-SDE' # Options are ['Flow-SDE', 'Dance-SDE', 'CPS', 'ODE'].
```

> **Note**: `ODE` dynamics produce deterministic trajectories and cannot provide log-probability estimates. Therefore, `ODE` can only be used with decoupled algorithms such as `NFT`, `AWM`, and `DGPO`. See the [DiffusionNFT](#diffusionnft), [AWM](#awm-advantage-weighted-matching), and [DGPO](#dgpo) sections.


### Efficiency Strategies


#### Mixing SDE and ODE

Training with the original Flow-GRPO and DanceGRPO methods is computationally expensive, as they require computing log probabilities and optimizing across all denoising steps.

Subsequent works, such as MixGRPO [[3]](#ref3) and TempFlow-GRPO [[4]](#ref4), investigated the effects of mixing ODE and SDE denoising rules. They found that applying SDE updates for only $1\sim 2$ steps—and optimizing only those corresponding steps—is sufficient. This approach significantly reduces the cost of the optimization stage and results in faster performance improvements.

To control this behavior, you can configure `sde_steps` and `num_sde_steps` as follows:

```yaml
scheduler:
    # Candidate steps for SDE noise (early steps typically provide more sample diversity)
    sde_steps: [1, 2, 3] 
    
    # Randomly select `1` step from the specified `sde_steps` list (e.g., step 2) 
    # to use SDE denoising. All other steps will use the standard ODE solver.
    num_sde_steps: 1
```

#### Decoupled Training and Inference Resolution

Flow-GRPO demonstrates that *lower-quality images, generated via fewer denoising steps, are often sufficient for reward computation and GRPO optimization*. PaCo-RL[[6]](#ref6) validates this insight from the perspective of **resolution**.

Research indicates that training on moderately low-resolution images yields sufficient reward signals to guide optimization effectively. Furthermore, *performance gains achieved at lower resolutions successfully transfer to high-resolution outputs*. Given that the computational complexity of modern Diffusion Transformers grows quadratically with image resolution, this decoupling significantly reduces training costs.

You can configure a smaller resolution for the sampling and optimization loop while maintaining the target resolution for inference and evaluation:

```yaml
train:
    resolution: 256  # Reduced resolution (int or [height, width]) for faster RL loops
eval:
    resolution: 1024 # Full resolution for validation and inference
```

### Regularization

#### KL-Loss

To tame the policy model's behavior and maintain proximity to the original reference model, two types of KL loss are available:

```yaml
train:
    kl_type: 'v-based' # Options: 'x-based', 'v-based'
    kl_beta: 0.04 # KL divergence beta
    ref_param_device: 'same_as_model' # Options: cpu, same_as_model
```

Here, `x-based` calculates the KL loss in the **latent space**,
while v-based calculates it in the **predicted velocity space** (or **noise space**).
The `kl_beta` parameter controls the coefficient of the KL divergence term.

**Memory Considerations**: Since calculating KL loss requires maintaining a copy of the original model, *VRAM usage scales with the number of trainable parameters*. 
- **LoRA Training**: The overhead is minimal and efficient.
- **Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning**: The overhead is significant. You may want to set `ref_param_device` to `cpu` to save memory.
- **No KL-Loss**: Setting `kl_beta` to `0` automatically disables this term and eliminates extra memory usage.

**Pack-composition-dependent adapters (e.g. Bagel)**: GRPO's on-policy step assumes `forward()` is bit-identical between rollout and training. Adapters that batch via sequence packing (NaViT) are not batch-invariant, so the default optimize-time sample shuffle breaks the on-policy `ratio == 1`. Set `train.shuffle_samples: false` (with matched sampling/training `per_device_batch_size`) for these adapters. See `workflow.md` Stage 6 and the train-inference consistency topic doc.


#### GRPO-Guard

The SDE formulation used in Flow-GRPO[[1]](#ref1) and DanceGRPO[[2]](#ref2) inherently results in a *negatively biased ratio distribution* during GRPO optimization. GRPO-Guard [[5]](#ref5) analyzes this phenomenon and proposes a normalization technique to mitigate reward hacking.

This normalization aligns with the time-step-dependent (and noise-level-dependent) loss re-weighting strategy introduced in TempFlow-GRPO[[4]](#ref4). By rebalancing the gradient contributions across different time steps, this strategy stabilizes training and effectively reduces reward hacking.

To enable this reweighting strategy, switch the `trainer_type` to `grpo-guard`:
```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'grpo-guard'
scheduler:
    dynamics_type: 'Flow-SDE'
```
> ‼️ **Note**: Currently, `grpo-guard` reweighting is only compatible with `Flow-GRPO` dynamics. Therefore, dynamics_type must be explicitly set to `Flow-SDE`.

## DPPO

Flow-DPPO (Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization) [[15]](#ref15) is a strict Flow-GRPO variant that keeps GRPO's group advantages and the optional KL-vs-reference penalty, but **replaces the PPO ratio-clip with a divergence proximal constraint**. The argument is that the single-sample probability ratio is a noisy estimate of the true policy divergence, so ratio clipping over-constrains some steps and under-constrains others. Because the per-step policy in a flow model is Gaussian, the KL between the old and new policies is exact and cheap to compute. DPPO uses this in an **asymmetric divergence mask**: it zeroes the gradient for any sample whose per-step KL(current ‖ rollout-old) exceeds `kl_mask_threshold` *and* whose update would push the action further in the wrong direction (`ratio > 1 & adv > 0`, or `ratio < 1 & adv < 0`).

The two KL computations are **decoupled**: `kl_mask_type` selects the space of the trust-region mask's KL(current ‖ old), while `kl_type` selects the space of the optional KL(current ‖ reference) penalty.

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'dppo'
    kl_mask_type: 'x-based'    # Trust-region mask KL(current||old) space: 'x-based' (next_latents_mean) or 'v-based' (noise_pred)
    kl_mask_threshold: 1.0e-6  # Per-step KL trust-region; larger keeps more samples
    kl_type: 'x-based'         # KL(current||reference) penalty space: 'x-based' or 'v-based'
    kl_beta: 1.0e-3            # Optional KL(current||reference) penalty (0 disables)
    kl_guidance_scale: 4.5     # CFG for the KL-vs-reference forward (Null = training guidance_scale)
```

Like GRPO, DPPO is **coupled** and must use SDE dynamics (`Flow-SDE`, `Dance-SDE`, `CPS`). `DPPOTrainingArguments` does not inherit `GRPOTrainingArguments` (no `clip_range`) — its field set is intentionally minimal. When `kl_beta > 0`, the KL-vs-reference term is evaluated at `kl_guidance_scale`; this is reflected in `DPPOTrainingArguments.get_preprocess_guidance_scale()` so negative prompts are encoded at preprocessing whenever `kl_guidance_scale > 1.0`. Example configs: `examples/dppo/lora/{flux2_klein_base,sd3_5}/geneval2_{single,multi}.yaml`.

## DPO

DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) [[11]](#ref11) is a **decoupled** algorithm that optimises a pairwise preference loss on flow-matching velocity targets. Instead of per-sample policy-gradient ratios, it forms chosen/rejected pairs within each group (based on per-sample advantages), then minimises a Bradley-Terry preference loss over the DSM errors of the two policies (current vs. frozen reference). To use this algorithm, set:

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'dpo'
```

### Core Parameters

```yaml
train:
    beta: 2000.0              # DPO temperature; larger ⇒ sharper preference contrast.
    ref_param_device: 'cuda'  # Device to store frozen reference parameters ('cpu' or 'cuda').
```

### Pair Formation & Advantage

DPO forms chosen/rejected pairs at the **start** of `optimize()` after `prepare_feedback()` has stored per-sample advantages. The `advantage_aggregation` controls how multi-reward advantages are combined:

```yaml
train:
    advantage_aggregation: 'gdpo'  # Options: 'sum', 'gdpo'. 'gdpo' normalizes each reward independently.
    global_std: true               # Global std normalization across all samples (vs. per-prompt).
```

### Training Timestep Distribution

```yaml
train:
    num_train_timesteps: 1              # Number of freshly sampled training timesteps per pair.
    weighting_scheme: 'logit_normal'    # Options: 'logit_normal', 'uniform'.
    logit_mean: 0.0                     # Mean for logit-normal sampling.
    logit_std: 1.0                      # Std for logit-normal sampling.
    time_shift: 1.0                     # Shift parameter (1.0 = no shift).
    timestep_range: 0.99               # Float ⇒ (0, x); tuple ⇒ (lo, hi).
```

## DGPO

DGPO (Direct Group Preference Optimization) [[8]](#ref8) is a **decoupled** algorithm that optimises a group-level preference loss on flow-matching targets. In particular, DGPO optimizes group-level preferences directly, extending the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to handle pairwise groups instead of pairwise samples. In concrete coding practice, DGPO implements a gradient-equivalent loss which aggregates each group's advantage-weighted DSM delta (current vs. reference) through a sigmoid and reweights every sample's DSM loss by the resulting per-group scalar. Training samples use `trajectory_indices=[-1]` and `compute_log_prob=False`; fresh timesteps are drawn from `TimeSampler` at each optimisation step. To use this algorithm, set:

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'dgpo'
```

Because the objective contrasts the current policy against a reference model, DGPO **always requires** a reference model (`requires_ref_model = True`).

### Core Loss Coefficients

```yaml
train:
    dpo_beta: 100.0           # DPO beta scaling for group preference; larger ⇒ sharper sigmoid weighting.
    kl_type: 'v-based'        # DGPO only supports v-based KL (other values are auto-coerced with a warning).
    kl_beta: 0.0              # KL penalty weight. 0 disables the KL term entirely.
    kl_cfg: 1.0               # CFG scale applied to the frozen reference. >1 enables CFG on the KL reference branch.
    guidance_scale: 4.5       # CFG during rollout process.
```

### Guidance on Hyper-parameter tuning

DGPO supports two modes: 1) rollout with CFG, training without CFG; 2) CFG-free in both rollout and training.

For the "rollout with CFG, training without CFG" mode, DGPO can achieve relatively fast training convergence and better OOD performance. As for the key hyperparameters, the reference model is typically frozen without CFG, the dpo_beta is generally set to 10 ~ 100 and clip_range is generally set to 1e-3 ~ 1e-2.

```yaml
# rollout with CFG, training without CFG
train:
    dpo_beta: 100.0           # DPO beta scaling for group preference; larger ⇒ sharper sigmoid weighting.
    kl_type: 'v-based'        # DGPO only supports v-based KL (other values are auto-coerced with a warning).
    kl_beta: 0.001            # KL penalty weight. 0 disables the KL term entirely.
    kl_cfg: 1.0               # CFG scale applied to the frozen reference. >1 enables CFG on the KL reference branch.
    guidance_scale: 4.5       # CFG during rollout process.
    clip_range: 1.0e-3        # PPO clip range (scalar is expanded to (-c, c)).
```

For the "CFG-free" mode, DGPO can achieve significantly faster convergence, but generally at the cost of some OOD performance. In this mode, it is recommended to use a small PPO-style clipping range by default: 1e-5 ~ 1e-4 for stable training. There are two settings for the reference model: one is to use a frozen reference model w/ CFG, in which case dpo_beta is typically set within the range of 10 ~ 100:

```yaml
#  CFG-free in both rollout and training. With frozen reference model.
train:
    dpo_beta: 100.0           # DPO beta scaling for group preference; larger ⇒ sharper sigmoid weighting.
    kl_type: 'v-based'        # DGPO only supports v-based KL (other values are auto-coerced with a warning).
    kl_beta: 0.001            # KL penalty weight. 0 disables the KL term entirely.
    kl_cfg: 4.5               # CFG scale applied to the frozen reference. >1 enables CFG on the KL reference branch.
    guidance_scale: 1.0       # CFG during rollout process.
    clip_range: 1.0e-5        # PPO clip range (scalar is expanded to (-c, c)).
```

Another choice for the reference model in "CFG-free" mode is to use an EMA model as a dynamic reference model, as proposed in TDM-R1 [[12]](#ref12). In this case, dpo_beta is typically set within a larger range of 2000 ~ 5000:

```yaml
#  CFG-free in both rollout and training. With dynamic reference model.
train:
    dpo_beta: 2000.0           # DPO beta scaling for group preference; larger ⇒ sharper sigmoid weighting.
    kl_type: 'v-based'        # DGPO only supports v-based KL (other values are auto-coerced with a warning).
    kl_beta: 0.001            # KL penalty weight. 0 disables the KL term entirely.
    kl_cfg: 1.0               # CFG scale applied to the reference. >1 enables CFG on the KL reference branch.
    guidance_scale: 1.0       # CFG during rollout process.
    clip_range: 1.0e-5        # PPO clip range (scalar is expanded to (-c, c)).
```


### Shared RNG across Groups

Cross-rank-deterministic sampling of both the training timesteps and the per-group noise (seeded from `(seed, epoch, inner_epoch, uid)`). The per-group noise is **timestep-invariant** — all training timesteps within an epoch share the same noise, matching the reference implementation. No `dist.broadcast` / RNG fork is used:

```yaml
train:
    use_shared_noise: true    # Same noise for every sample within a group at each step.
```

### PPO-style Clipping and EMA reference model

A fast-tracking EMA copy of the trainable parameters (`ema_ref`, distinct from the slow sampling EMA) acts as the "old policy" for PPO-style clipping on the DSM / KL losses:

```yaml
train:
    clip_dsm: true            # Clip the DSM loss when the ratio exits clip_range.
    clip_kl: false            # Optionally clip the KL loss using the same ratio mask.
    clip_range: 1.0e-2        # PPO clip range (scalar is expanded to (-c, c)).
    adv_clip_range: 5.0       # Advantage clipping range.
    use_ema_ref: false        # If true, use ema_ref (not the frozen ref) as the DGPO loss reference (TDM-R1 dynamic ref).

    ema_ref_max_decay: 0.3    # Cap of the adaptive decay.
    ema_ref_ramp_rate: 1.0e-3 # Adaptive decay = min(ema_ref_max_decay, ema_ref_ramp_rate * step).
    ema_ref_device: 'cuda'    # Where ema_ref parameters live.
```

`clip_dsm`, `clip_kl`, or `use_ema_ref` being enabled triggers the creation and per-step update of `ema_ref`; otherwise no fast EMA is maintained.

### Sampling Policy Switch

```yaml
train:
    off_policy: false         # If true, use the slow sampling EMA for trajectory generation from step 0.
    switch_ema_ref: 200       # After this many optimizer steps, swap to ema_ref (fast EMA) for sampling.
```

### Training Timestep Distribution

```yaml
train:
    num_train_timesteps: 0    # 0 ⇒ int(num_inference_steps * (timestep_range[1] - timestep_range[0])).
    time_sampling_strategy: 'discrete'  # Options: discrete, discrete_with_init, discrete_wo_init, uniform, logit_normal.
    time_shift: 3.0           # Shift for logit_normal / uniform strategies.
    timestep_range: 0.6       # Float ⇒ (0, x); tuple ⇒ (lo, hi) along the 1000→0 denoise axis.
```

> **Note**: DGPO feeds scheduler-scale timesteps (`[0, 1000]`) into `flow_match_sigma` before constructing `x_t = (1 - σ) x_0 + σ ε`. Training directly on unscaled timesteps would drive reward downward — the σ-scaling is mandatory for correct flow-matching behaviour.

### Group Completeness

DGPO's group-level sigmoid reweighting is only meaningful if every optimizer step sees a **complete group** (all `K = group_size` copies of each prompt). Flow-Factory guarantees this by requiring `GroupDistributedSampler` for DGPO (auto-forced by `Arguments._resolve_sampler_type`).

**How it works**: `GroupDistributedSampler` yields the same prompt-index sequence on every rank; each prompt appears `K / W` times per rank (`W` = `num_replicas`). Since all ranks see the same prompts, local `torch.unique` produces a cross-rank-consistent dense group-id space — no `gather_samples` or cross-rank id coordination is needed. The single `accelerator.reduce` inside `_compute_group_dgpo_loss` sums partial per-rank contributions to recover the full-group sigmoid weight.

**Geometric constraint**: `(num_replicas × per_device_batch_size) % group_size == 0` must hold so that every global micro-batch packs an integer number of complete groups. `Arguments._align_for_group_distributed` auto-adjusts `group_size` (and then `unique_sample_num_per_epoch`) at init time to satisfy this, so no manual tuning is needed.

For a complete runnable setup, see `examples/dgpo/lora/sd3_5/default.yaml`.

## DiffusionNFT

This algorithm is introduced in [[7]](#ref7). Unlike GRPO, which couples sampling dynamics with training timesteps, **DiffusionNFT** decouples them entirely by optimizing a contrastive objective directly on the forward flow-matching process.

Concretely, DiffusionNFT contrasts implicit positive and negative policies ($v_\theta^+$ and $v_\theta^-$), weighted by a normalized reward $r \in [0, 1]$, to identify a policy improvement direction *without* requiring tractable likelihood estimation or SDE-based sampling. This makes the algorithm inherently solver-agnostic.

To use this algorithm, set:

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'nft'
```

Since DiffusionNFT decouples training from sampling dynamics, you can freely choose the sampling solver. Using the `ODE` solver during sampling typically yields higher image quality:

```yaml
train:
  num_train_timesteps: 2 # Number of timesteps to train on. Set `null` to all timesteps.
  time_sampling_strategy: discrete_with_init # Options: uniform, logit_normal, discrete, discrete_with_init, discrete_wo_init
  time_shift: 3.0
  timestep_fraction: 0.3 # Train using only the first 30% of timesteps.

scheduler:
    dynamics_type: 'ODE' # Other options are also available.
```

> **Note**: Since Reinforcement Learning typically requires exploration, it is often beneficial to experiment with SDE-based `dynamics_type` settings as well. Using `CPS`[[9]](#ref9) for NFT sampling is also a good choice.

### Old Policy via EMA

The original DiffusionNFT implementation maintains two separate EMA copies of the model: one for general EMA smoothing and one as the "old policy" used for off-policy sampling. Flow-Factory simplifies this design by retaining only a single EMA copy that serves as the old policy. This reduces memory overhead while preserving the core stabilization mechanism.

When `off_policy` is enabled, the EMA model is used to generate trajectories during sampling, while the current policy is optimized against these trajectories. This off-policy setup stabilizes training by preventing the sampling distribution from shifting too rapidly.

```yaml
train:
  off_policy: true  # Use EMA parameters for off-policy sampling
  ema_decay_schedule: "piecewise_linear"  # Options: constant, power, linear, piecewise_linear, cosine, warmup_cosine
  ema_decay: 0.5        # EMA decay rate (0 to disable)
  ema_update_interval: 1  # EMA update interval (in epochs)
  ema_device: "cuda"      # Device to store EMA model (options: cpu, cuda)
```

> **Tip**: The `piecewise_linear` schedule is recommended for DiffusionNFT. It starts with a lower decay rate to allow faster initial policy divergence and gradually increases the decay to stabilize later training. You can fine-tune this behavior with `flat_steps` and `ramp_rate`.

### Optional T2I Critique Refinement

DiffusionNFT can consume Flow-Factory's standalone `critique` component. The component itself is algorithm-neutral: it accepts generated T2I samples plus named reward axes, obtains replacement captions through a backend with a row-aligned asynchronous interface, validates the replacements, renders paired round-2 samples from the same per-batch random initialization, and evaluates round 2 against the **original** prompt. The resulting pair is attached to each sample for an algorithm-specific loss. At present, only DiffusionNFT consumes that pair; the losses of GRPO, DPPO, DPO, DGPO, AWM, CRD, and DiffusionOPD are unchanged.

For a valid rewrite $c'$ and its same-seed clean latent $x'_0$, the critique advantage is

$$
A_{\text{crit}} = \operatorname{clip}\left(\frac{r_2 - \mu_1(\text{prompt})}{\sigma_1}, -1, 1\right),
$$

where $r_2$ is scored against the original prompt, $\mu_1(\text{prompt})$ is the group's round-1 reward mean, and $\sigma_1$ is the global round-1 reward standard deviation. Invalid/empty/unchanged rewrites fall back to the original prompt and receive $A_{\text{crit}}=0$.

The native DiffusionNFT objective remains the primary loss. Critique adds only the auxiliary direction term

$$
L = L_{\text{NFT}} + \lambda A_{\text{crit}}\sigma_t^2
\left\|v_\theta(x_t,c)-\operatorname{sg}\left[v_\theta(x'_t,c')\right]\right\|_2^2 + L_{\text{KL}},
$$

using the same training timestep and Gaussian noise for $x_t$ and $x'_t$. The rewrite target is the online current policy with stop-gradient; the auxiliary term does not add a second old-policy anchor. `critique_loss_weight` is $\lambda$ and defaults to `0.1`. The safe component default is `advantage_mode: nonnegative`. Set `signed` to reproduce the current AdvantageFlow recipe; because negative rows can reduce curvature, keep the auxiliary weight small.

```yaml
critique:
  enabled: true
  backend: openai-compatible       # Or module.path:CustomBackend
  model: google/gemini-2.5-flash
  base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  api_key_env: OPENROUTER_KEY      # Read from the environment; never stored in config
  mode: geneval_rewrite_antihal    # See recipe list below; detail_rewrite for preference/aesthetic rewards
  prompts_yaml: null               # Optional hot-reloaded prompt-recipe overlay YAML
  reward_name: geneval
  validator: geneval               # Use none outside GenEval
  advantage_mode: nonnegative      # nonnegative (safe default) or signed
  advantage_clip_range: [-1.0, 1.0] # Lower bound is raised to 0 in nonnegative mode
  num_workers: 8
  image_format: jpeg

train:
  trainer_type: nft
  critique_loss_weight: 0.1
```

**Prompt recipes.** Four built-in recipes ship with the component, ported verbatim from the validated AdvantageFlow critic prompts (their exact wording is load-bearing — add new recipe names for experiments instead of editing them):

| `mode` | Use with | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `geneval_rewrite` | Compositional rewards (GenEval) | Copy the target prompt, make only failed requirements explicit, add nothing else. |
| `geneval_rewrite_antihal` | Compositional rewards | `geneval_rewrite` + an anti-hallucination guard (never name objects the target did not ask for). The winning arm of the GenEval critique-prompt ablation. |
| `geneval_rewrite_nocosmetic` | Compositional rewards | Additionally bans cosmetic edits (`a`/`an` → `one`, inserting `directly`/`exactly`) that empirically tied or reduced reward. |
| `detail_rewrite` | Preference/aesthetic rewards (PickScore, HPS) | Keep the subject, add vivid photographic detail. |

`prompts_yaml` points to an overlay file with schema `recipes.<name>.{system, user_builder}` (user builders: `geneval_rewrite`, `detail_rewrite`). The file is re-read on modification, so editing it changes a **live** run's next critique batch without a restart; a recipe named after a built-in mode overrides it.

The built-in backend launches all API rows concurrently. Once the first rollout pack's replies are ready, its round-2 render can run while later API rows remain in flight. The current implementation begins this phase after round-1 reward finalization; it does not yet couple directly to `RewardBuffer` futures to overlap critique with round-1 sampling. Rewritten prompts require online text encoding, so preprocessed runs temporarily load the adapter's text encoders during paired refinement.

For a complete runnable GenEval setup, see [`examples/nft/lora/sd3_5/geneval_critique.yaml`](../examples/nft/lora/sd3_5/geneval_critique.yaml).

### Optional Privileged-Prompt Distillation (PPD)

PPD is the records-based sibling of the critique component and is mutually exclusive with it. There is no API call, no second rendering, and no reward interaction: rollout generation and every reward stay conditioned on the **original** prompt, and a precomputed privileged prompt $c'$ (from `ppd.records_path`, joined to samples by exact original-prompt text) is visible to the loss only. This isolates transferred training signal from easier conditioning — the matched control arm (`rho: 0.0`) executes identical plumbing and its objective is exactly the native baseline.

At each NFT training state $x_t$ the lagged EMA sampling policy $v_{\text{old}}$ (which DiffusionNFT already queries for its own loss) supplies a same-state CFG target, and the auxiliary rows are

$$
L_{\text{PPD}} = \rho\, m\, \sigma_t^2 \left\|v_\theta(x_t,c) - \operatorname{sg}\!\left[v_{\text{old}}(x_t,c) + \kappa\,(v_{\text{old}}(x_t,c') - v_{\text{old}}(x_t,c))\right]\right\|_2^2,
$$

where $m$ is the identity mask (rows whose privileged prompt equals the original are inactive) and $\kappa \in [0,1]$ interpolates the teacher target (`kappa: 1.0` distills the fully privileged-conditioned velocity). Only one extra no-grad teacher forward per timestep is added; the base teacher is the existing old-policy prediction. In the AdvantageFlow reference this distillation runs at stored reverse-process rollout states; the Flow-Factory adaptation applies it at DiffusionNFT's own re-noised training states, so the student and teacher always share the exact state the native loss is optimizing.

```yaml
ppd:
  enabled: true
  records_path: "${RUNTIME_ROOT}/data/geneval_stock_ppd_pairs/records.jsonl"
  rho: 100.0         # 0.0 = matched control; see the calibration note below
  kappa: 1.0
  timestep_weighted: true   # multiply rows by sigma_t^2
  mask_identity: true       # unchanged privileged prompts are inactive
  require_records_coverage: true

train:
  trainer_type: nft
  off_policy: true          # required: the EMA sampling policy is the teacher
```

**Calibrating `rho`.** The calibration metric is `ppd/to_native_abs_loss`, the auxiliary/native loss-magnitude ratio, targeted at roughly 1% (the AdvantageFlow production target; AF measured a gradient ratio, which does not port cleanly under ZeRO, so Flow-Factory uses the loss ratio as its proxy). Do **not** copy `rho` values across trainers: the ratio depends on the native loss scale, and DiffusionNFT's policy loss (`/nft_beta`, `* adv_clip`) is orders of magnitude larger than AF's flow-matching loss. Measured at production geometry (step-0 epoch): the stock-GenEval config (native ~24, `nft_beta=0.1`) reads 0.56% at `rho=60`, so the shipped `rho: 100.0` lands ~0.93%; the Pick-a-Pic three-reward config (native ~2.2, `nft_beta=1.0`) reads 0.85% at `rho=7`, so the shipped `rho: 8.0` lands ~0.97%. The ratio is linear in `rho`: run one short epoch, read `ppd/to_native_abs_loss`, and scale.

**Correctness metrics.** `ppd/control_zero` must be exactly `0` on every step of a `rho: 0.0` control run (objective purity). `ppd/data_coverage_rate` and `ppd/data_active_rate` report records coverage and changed-row share; `ppd/teacher_delta_rms` and `ppd/target_displacement_rms` bound how far the privileged conditioning moves the teacher target. Records for the stock GenEval and Pick-a-Pic baselines are staged with `scripts/prepare_ppd_records.sh`.

## AWM: Advantage Weighted Matching

This algorithm is introduced in [[10]](#ref10). **Advantage Weighted Matching** further aligns RL optimization with the flow-matching pretraining objective by weighting the standard velocity matching loss with per-sample advantages. This formulation incorporates reward-based guidance directly into the velocity matching loss, effectively aligning the optimization target with the original flow-matching objective.

Like DiffusionNFT, AWM decouples training from sampling dynamics and is therefore solver-agnostic. To use this algorithm, set:

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'awm'
```

The relevant sampling and timestep configuration parameters are the same as those described in the [DiffusionNFT](#diffusionnft) section.

### Training Stability

AWM typically converges faster than other algorithms due to its direct advantage weighting on the velocity matching loss. However, this rapid update dynamic also makes it more prone to training instability — the policy can diverge quickly if left unconstrained, leading to reward hacking or training collapse.

To stabilize AWM training, it is strongly recommended to combine **EMA-based KL regularization** with **PPO-style clipping**:

```yaml
train:
  trainer_type: 'awm'
  # EMA KL regularization: penalizes deviation from the EMA-smoothed policy
  ema_kl_beta: 0.1        # Coefficient of KL loss between current policy and EMA policy
  ema_decay: 0.9           # EMA decay rate
  ema_decay_schedule: 'power'  # Options: constant, power, linear, piecewise_linear, cosine, warmup_cosine
  ema_update_interval: 1   # EMA update interval (in epochs)
  ema_device: "cuda"
  # PPO-style clipping: prevents excessively large policy updates
  clip_range: 1.0e-5       # Clipping range for the policy ratio
  adv_clip_range: 5.0      # Advantage clipping range
```

> ‼️ **Important**: Disabling both `ema_kl_beta` and `clip_range` simultaneously is **not recommended** for AWM, as the unconstrained advantage weighting can easily lead to training collapse. In practice, `ema_kl_beta` serves as a soft constraint that keeps the current policy close to a moving average, while `clip_range` provides a hard constraint on per-step policy updates.

### AWM Weighting

AWM computes a per-sample matching loss $\ell = \|v_\theta(x_t, t) - ({\epsilon} - {x}_0)\|^2$ and then applies a weighting function $w(\ell, t)$ before multiplying by the advantage. Different weighting strategies control how the raw matching loss magnitude and timestep position influence the gradient signal:

```yaml
train:
  awm_weighting: 'ghuber'  # Options: Uniform, t, t**2, huber, ghuber
  ghuber_power: 0.25        # Power parameter for generalized Huber weighting (only used with 'ghuber')
```

| Weighting  | Formula $w(\ell, t)$                                                  | Description                                                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Uniform`  | $\ell$                                                                | No reweighting. All timesteps contribute equally.                                                     |
| `t`        | $t \cdot \ell$                                                        | Linear timestep weighting. Upweights noisier (larger $t$) timesteps.                                  |
| `t**2`     | $t^2 \cdot \ell$                                                      | Quadratic timestep weighting. More aggressively upweights noisier timesteps.                          |
| `huber`    | $t \cdot (\sqrt{\ell + \varepsilon} - \varepsilon)$                   | Huber-style loss that suppresses large matching errors, weighted by $t$.                              |
| `ghuber`   | $\frac{t}{p} \cdot ((\ell + \varepsilon)^{p} - \varepsilon^{p})$     | Generalized Huber loss with power $p$ (`ghuber_power`). Provides tunable robustness against outliers. |

Here $\varepsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability and $p$ denotes `ghuber_power` (default `0.25`).

> **Tip**: `ghuber` with a small power (e.g., `0.25`) provides a good balance between robustness and gradient signal strength. `Uniform` is the simplest baseline and works well when reward signals are clean and low-variance.

> **Note**: Like DPO, DGPO, DiffusionNFT, and AWM are foward-diffusion based RL algorithms, which decouples training from sampling dynamics and is solver-agnostic — any ODE/SDE solver can be used for trajectory generation.


## CRD: Centered Reward Distillation

This algorithm is introduced in [[13]](#ref13). **Centered Reward Distillation (CRD)** is a forward-process RL method that matches implicit model rewards (estimated from prediction error in velocity space) with centered external rewards. The key insight is that the unknown prompt-dependent normalizer cancels under *within-prompt centering*, yielding a well-posed reward-matching objective.

CRD maintains two named parameter snapshots alongside the current model:
- **Old model** (`_crd_old`): used to estimate implicit rewards via prediction error difference.
- **Sampling model** (`_crd_sampling`): used for off-policy rollout generation, blended toward the current model over time.

To use this algorithm, set:

```yaml
train:
    trainer_type: 'crd'
```

| `> 0` | Softmax temperature | Dual-direction: `softmax(adv/τ)` and `softmax(-adv/τ)` |


## DiffusionOPD: On-Policy Distillation

This algorithm is introduced in [[14]](#ref14). **DiffusionOPD** is a *decoupled-paradigm* multi-task distillation method: instead of jointly optimizing several rewards from scratch, it first trains one task-specialized **teacher** per task (e.g. GenEval, OCR, aesthetics) and then distills their capabilities into a single unified **student** along the student's own rollout trajectories. This reduces reward conflict and catastrophic forgetting relative to multi-reward RL.

Unlike the policy-gradient algorithms above, the loss is a closed-form **per-step KL on the denoising transition** — a pathwise mean-matching objective that covers both stochastic SDE samplers and deterministic ODE samplers:

```
kl_div_j = 0.5 * || mu_S - mu_T ||^2 / denom
```

where `mu_S` / `mu_T` are the student / teacher transition means at the student-visited state `x_j`, and `denom` is the scheduler's transition variance for the active dynamics (centralized in `scheduler.get_kl_divergence_denominator`):

| `dynamics_type` | `denom` | resulting `kl_div_j` |
|---|---|---|
| `ODE` | `1.0` | pure mean matching: `0.5 * ||μ_S − μ_T||²` |
| `Flow-SDE`, `Dance-SDE` | `std_dev_t² · (-dt)` | Gaussian transition KL: `||μ_S − μ_T||² / (2 σ̄²)` |
| `CPS` | `std_dev_t²` | `||μ_S − μ_T||² / (2 std_dev_t²)` |

There is no loss-scaling coefficient (DiffusionOPD has no REINFORCE term). Rewards are used **only** for periodic eval monitoring (`evaluate()`), never in the distillation loss.

### How it works (2-pass per epoch)

Built directly on the multi-dataset infrastructure (`data.datasets`, per-source `source`/`source_id`, `train_dataloaders_by_source`), so each teacher is routed to one or more training datasets:

1. **`sample()`** — the student rolls out on-policy trajectories over the multi-source dataloader (each sample tagged with its `source`), reusing the standard sampling pipeline.
2. **`optimize()` PASS 1** (`no_grad`) — for each teacher (exactly **one** weight swap, via the named-parameter snapshot), forward over its routed samples' stored states `x_j` and cache the teacher means `mu_T` on each sample.
3. **`optimize()` PASS 2** (student params only) — a standard gradient loop forwards the student at the same `x_j`, matching each sample's `mu_S` to its own cached `mu_T` (a micro-batch may mix teachers; the batch-mean is an implicit per-teacher KL averaged over the batch).

Teacher swaps are thus **M-per-epoch** (one per teacher), the gradient loop runs with student params only (no autocast-cache toggling, no DDP bypass), and the loss is a clean student-vs-cached-target MSE.

Which denoising steps are distilled is set by `train.timestep_range` (default `0.99`), the same fraction idiom NFT uses: a float `f` selects the band `[0, f]` of the trajectory's step indices (the first `f`-fraction of denoising steps, skipping the near-clean tail), and a tuple is an explicit `[lo, hi]` band. This reproduces upstream DiffusionOPD's `timestep_fraction` and is **dynamics-agnostic** — it selects by trajectory step index rather than the SDE-only stochastic-step set, so it works identically under ODE and SDE.

### Teacher loading

Teachers are **LoRA-only** (full-parameter teachers are deferred). Each teacher checkpoint is loaded into a named-parameter snapshot and **must share the student's LoRA architecture** (same `target_components` / target modules, compatible rank/alpha), because it is loaded into the student's active adapter slot. Local paths and Hugging Face Hub repo ids are both accepted.

To use this algorithm, set:

```yaml
train:
  trainer_type: 'diffusion-opd'

  teachers:
    - name: "geneval-teacher"                            # unique id (named snapshot + log keys)
      path: "quanhaol/DiffusionOPD/GenEvalTeacher/lora"  # local path or HF spec owner/repo[/subfolder][@rev]
      applicable_datasets: [geneval]                     # distill on geneval rollouts
      # guidance_scale: 4.5                              # (optional) per-teacher CFG override (null = student CFG)
    - name: "ocr-teacher"
      path: "quanhaol/DiffusionOPD/OCRTeacher/lora"
      applicable_datasets: [ocr]

  teacher_param_device: 'cuda'  # teacher snapshot device: 'cuda' (fast swaps) / 'cpu' (low VRAM)
  guidance_scale: 1.0           # student CFG for rollout + forward
  timestep_range: 0.99          # distill the first 99% of denoising steps (upstream timestep_fraction)

scheduler:
  dynamics_type: "ODE"  # mean matching; switch to Flow-SDE + noise_level>0 for SDE distillation
  noise_level: 0.0
```

Each teacher's `applicable_datasets` must reference declared `data.datasets[*].name` entries (validated at config load). The config schema allows several teachers to share a dataset for a future multi-teacher/ensemble trainer, but the current `DiffusionOPDTrainer` requires exactly one teacher per dataset and raises otherwise. See [`examples/opd/lora/sd3_5/`](../examples/opd/lora/sd3_5/) for two complete configs (`DiffusionOPD_aligned.yaml` to reproduce official results).
