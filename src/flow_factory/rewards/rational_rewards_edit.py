COMMON_TASK_GUIDELINE = """To do this, you must first assess the image on four critical aspects, provide justifications and absolute scores in 1-4 scale.

### Critical Aspects & Scoring Rubric
**1. Text Faithfulness** (How accurately does the output follow the instruction?)
- **4 (Full match):** All key elements (objects, colors, actions) are represented exactly as described. No hallucinations or unrequested changes.
- **3 (Minor mismatch):** Most key elements are present, but minor details are missing, incorrect, or slightly inaccurate.
- **2 (Some mismatch):** Some key elements are missing, altered, or interpreted incorrectly.
- **1 (Major deviations):** Key elements are completely missing, altered, or contradicted. Instruction is ignored.

**2. Image Faithfulness** (How well are the non-edited parts and key input elements preserved?)
- **4 (Uses input fully):** All relevant elements from the input (background, style, lighting, identity) are accurately preserved or transformed as instructed.
- **3 (Minor mismatch):** Most relevant elements are preserved, but a few aspects (e.g., background details, lighting consistency) are missing or incorrectly handled.
- **2 (Partial mismatch):** Some elements are carried over, but key aspects of the original image are lost or distorted.
- **1 (Fails to use input):** Key elements of the input image are ignored, misinterpreted, or destroyed.

**3. Physical and Visual Quality** (Technical errors, composition, realism, and physics)
- **4 (No noticeable flaws):** The image is physically plausible (correct lighting, shadows, geometry, anatomy). No visible artifacts (seams, blurring, noise).
- **3 (Minor flaws):** Small inaccuracies that are noticeable but not strongly disruptive (e.g., slight lighting mismatch, minor texture issues).
- **2 (Some flaws):** Clear physical or visual errors that disrupt the image (e.g., incorrect perspective, "floating" objects, wrong shadow direction, obvious seams).
- **1 (Severe flaws):** Major physical/visual errors (e.g., impossible geometry, distorted anatomy, garbled objects, severe artifacts).

**4. Text Rendering** (Only if the instruction involves generating text)
- **4 (Full match):** Text is correct, legible, and integrated well.
- **3 (Mostly match):** Minor misspellings or inconsistent capitalization.
- **2 (Partial match):** Major misspellings or distorted text.
- **1 (Major deviations):** Text is unreadable, severely distorted, or missing. (Use N/A if no text generation is required).

### Scoring Methodology (CRITICAL)
During assessment for each aspect, recall the initial user request, source image and the scoring rubrics of the aspect, provide scores with detailed justifications for each image and reflect fine-grained preferences.
1. **Anchor:** Have a global inspection based on the user request and the resulting generation. Determine the rough integer score level (1, 2, 3, or 4) according to the definitions provided .
2. **Justify and Adjust:** Do careful visual analysis and identify specific flaws in generation. Justify the score with concrete evidence and scoring logic. Fine-tune this anchor score into a float value. Add small increments for exceptional execution or deduct points for specific flaws.
   - *Example:* deduct points from 4.0 for slight flaws if the assessed dimension is close to satisfaction. add increments from 1.0 or 2.0 based on severity of flaws.

Afterwards, try to construct a refined user request that helps the visual generation model to produce better image edits.
Think of the weaknesses identified in the judgement, then map them to instruction details and apply specific fixes.
Provide a final new user request that enrich the initial user request.

Output your evaluation in the following format:
# User Request Analysis
[ understanding the user request, try to analyze or decompose the user request deeper. Think of what the request might imply or what needs to be inferred to successfully execute the request. ]
# Detailed Judgement
1. Text Faithfulness:
## Justification: [ Analysis of the user request and the assessment of the resulting generation. How it comes to a final score. ]
## Score: [ float score ]
2. Image Faithfulness:
## Justification: [ Similar to above. Analysis and assessment. ]
## Score: [ float score ]
3. Physical and Visual Quality:
## Justification: [ Similar to above. Analysis and assessment. ]
## Score: [ float score ]
4. Text Rendering:
## Justification: [ Similar to above. Analysis and assessment. ]
## Score: [ float score or N/A ]
# Summary: [ Summary of the evaluation ]

# User Request Refinement:
## Refinement Comments: [Specific suggestions for improving the user request]
## Refined Request: [The improved, more specific user request for editing like a standard user instruction]"""
