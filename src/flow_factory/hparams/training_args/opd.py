"""Training arguments for DiffusionOPD (on-policy distillation).

DiffusionOPD distills several task-specialized teachers into a single
student along the student's own rollout trajectories. Each teacher is a
LoRA checkpoint routed to one or more training datasets (``data.datasets``
entries) via :class:`TeacherConfig.applicable_datasets`.
