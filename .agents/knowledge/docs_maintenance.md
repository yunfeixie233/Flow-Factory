# Knowledge Documentation Maintenance

**Read when**: Adding or editing `.agents/` documentation.

## Architecture

The knowledge system uses a 3-layer design with bidirectional cross-references:

```
Root:    AGENTS.md                          — project identity, behavioral principles (one-liners)
Tier 1:  philosophy.md, constraints.md,     — core thesis + concise indexes (always read)
         architecture.md
Routing: README.md                          — trigger-based table from Tier 1 to Tier 2
Leaves:  topics/*.md                        — self-contained detail (read when triggered)
Skills:  skills/*/SKILL.md                  — workflows with downward refs to topics
```

## Node Roles

**Non-leaf** (root + Tier 1): State core thesis in 1-3 lines, then index to leaf docs via tables or pointers. No inline explanations, no code examples, no checklists — those belong in leaves.

**Leaf** (`topics/*.md`): Self-contained, concise, essential knowledge. Include code refs, checklists, numbered gotchas. No filler prose, no introductory fluff, no restating what parent docs already say. Format examples: `adapter_conventions.md`, `train_inference_consistency.md`.

**Routing** (`README.md`): Trigger-based table only. Each row maps a change area to the topic doc an agent should read. No prose.

## Cross-Reference Rules

1. Every leaf links **UP** to its constraint/architecture source via a `## Cross-refs` section at the bottom.
2. Every skill links **DOWN** to relevant topics via `## Related Topics` or `## Pre-Review Reading`.
3. Reference constraint numbers (e.g., `constraints.md #7`) instead of re-explaining the rule.
4. No duplication across layers — if detail exists in a leaf, the parent points to it rather than restating it.

## Maintenance Checklist

When modifying the knowledge system, verify these steps:

| Change | Required updates |
|--------|-----------------|
| New topic doc | Add row to `README.md` routing table with trigger condition |
| New topic doc | Add cross-refs in relevant skills (`ff-develop`, `ff-debug`, `ff-review`, `ff-new-model`) |
| New constraint | Update quick index range in `constraints.md` header + section header (e.g., extend `#21-27` Code Quality or add a new category such as `#28-29` Agent Workflow) |
| Append-only list | `Numbered Gotchas`, `FF-Specific Pitfalls` — only append, never reorder or remove |
| Any doc change | All text in English (`constraints.md` #21) |
| Moved detail | Replace inline content with pointer to the leaf that now holds it |
