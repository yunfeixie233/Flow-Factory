## Registry & Loading (1–5)

### 1. Registry Path Accuracy
The three registries (`_TRAINER_REGISTRY`, `_MODEL_ADAPTER_REGISTRY`, `_REWARD_MODEL_REGISTRY`) map string identifiers to **fully qualified Python class paths** for lazy import. If you move, rename, or restructure a class, the corresponding registry entry MUST be updated, or `ImportError` will occur at runtime.

### 2. Registry Identifier Convention
Registry keys are **case-insensitive** (lowered at lookup). Model adapter keys use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `flux1-kontext`). Trainer keys use lowercase (e.g., `grpo-guard`). Reward keys use lowercase (e.g., `pickscore`). New entries must follow the same convention.

### 3. Dynamic Import Fallback
All three registries support a **direct Python path** fallback (e.g., `my_package.models.CustomAdapter`). If an identifier is not found in the registry, it is treated as a fully qualified import path. Do not break this two-mode resolution logic.

### 4. Decorator Registration
`@register_trainer` and `@register_reward_model` decorators exist for convenience but the canonical entries are the static dicts. If you use the decorator, ensure the static dict is also updated if the class should be discoverable by default.

### 5. Adapter `load_pipeline()` Must Return a DiffusionPipeline
Every `BaseAdapter` subclass's `load_pipeline()` must return a `diffusers.DiffusionPipeline` (or compatible object). The base class's `__init__` immediately accesses `.scheduler` on the returned object.

---

## Training Pipeline (6–10)

### 6. Six-Stage Pipeline Order
The training loop executes: Data Preprocessing → K-Repeat Sampling → Trajectory Generation → Reward Computation → Advantage Computation → Policy Optimization. This order is invariant. Do not reorder or skip stages.

### 7. Coupled vs Decoupled Paradigm
- **Coupled** (GRPO, GRPO-Guard, DPPO): Training timesteps are coupled with SDE-based sampling. Requires log-probability computation. Must use SDE dynamics (`Flow-SDE`, `Dance-SDE`, `CPS`).
- **Decoupled** (DPO, NFT, AWM, DGPO, CRD): Training timesteps are decoupled from sampling. Can use any dynamics including `ODE`.
- **Distillation** (`diffusion-opd`): On-policy multi-teacher distillation; dynamics-agnostic (ODE or SDE) and has no reward/advantage stage.

Mixing paradigms (e.g., using `ODE` dynamics with `GRPO`) will produce incorrect gradients silently.

### 8. Component Offloading Lifecycle
Text encoders and VAEs are loaded for Stage 1 (preprocessing), then offloaded to free VRAM before the training loop. They are reloaded for inference during sampling. Do not assume these components are always on-device.

### 9. Accelerator `prepare()` Scope
Only **trainable modules** and the **optimizer** go through `accelerator.prepare()`. The dataloader uses a custom distributed sampler (`DistributedKRepeatSampler`, `GroupContiguousSampler`, or `GroupDistributedSampler`) and is NOT prepared via accelerator. Breaking this causes duplicate data or incorrect gradient accumulation.

### 9a. Sampler Geometric Constraints
`DistributedKRepeatSampler` and `GroupContiguousSampler` require `M * K ≡ 0 (mod W * B * G)` where M=unique_sample_num, K=group_size, W=world_size, B=per_device_batch_size, G=gradient_step_per_epoch — **unless** `gradient_accumulation_steps` is set manually, in which case the constraint reduces to `M * K ≡ 0 (mod W * B)`. **GroupContiguousSampler** adds: `M ≡ 0 (mod W)`. **GroupDistributedSampler** (DGPO) requires: `K % W == 0` and `(W * B) % K == 0`; auto-aligned by `_align_for_group_distributed`. See `topics/samplers.md` for full details.

### 10. DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 Is Unsupported
Reward model sharding under ZeRO-3 is broken even with `GatherParameter` context manager (see the ZeRO-3 guard comment in `trainers/abc.py`). Only ZeRO-1 and ZeRO-2 are safe. Document this if users ask.

---

## Base Class Interfaces (11–14)

### 11. BaseTrainer Abstract Contract
`BaseTrainer.__init__` expects `(accelerator, config, adapter)`. Subclasses must implement the three abstract methods `start()`, `prepare_feedback()`, and `optimize()`. `evaluate()` is a **concrete** base method — override only to customize evaluation. The `_initialization()` method handles dataloader, optimizer, accelerator preparation, reward model loading, and `AdvantageProcessor` instantiation — do not duplicate this logic.

**Per-epoch hook order**: `sample()` (Stages 2–3) → `prepare_feedback()` (Stages 4–5) → `optimize()` (Stage 6). `DPOTrainer` forms chosen/rejected pairs at the **start** of `optimize()` (not in `prepare_feedback()`).

**Trainer hierarchy**: New trainers MUST inherit directly from `BaseTrainer`. The only sanctioned exceptions are strict behavioral variants of GRPO that change only the per-step loss while reusing GRPO's sampling/advantage/eval machinery: `GRPOGuardTrainer → GRPOTrainer` (adds ratio-normalization) and `DPPOTrainer → GRPOTrainer` (replaces the PPO ratio-clip with a KL trust-region mask). Trainer-to-trainer inheritance creates fragile coupling; when in doubt, inherit from `BaseTrainer` and extract shared logic into helper methods. All reward-based trainers delegate advantage computation to `self.advantage_processor.compute_advantages()`; the distillation trainer `diffusion-opd` is the exception (its `prepare_feedback()` is a no-op with no reward/advantage stage).

### 12. BaseAdapter Abstract Methods
Subclasses of `BaseAdapter` MUST implement these **4 abstract methods**:
- `load_pipeline()` → returns a DiffusionPipeline
- `decode_latents()` → latents → pixels
- `inference()` → full multi-step denoising (corresponds to pipeline `__call__`)
- `forward()` → single-step denoising for training loss computation

**Optional encoder overrides (no-op default)**: All four per-modality encoders are non-abstract on `BaseAdapter`. Their default body is `pass` (returns `None`). Override only the modalities your model actually consumes — text/image/video-only adapters do **not** need stub `pass` overrides for unused modalities.
- `encode_prompt()` → text → embeddings
- `encode_image()` → image → latents
- `encode_video()` → video frames → latents
- `encode_audio()` → audio waveforms → embeddings/features

Note: `preprocess_func()` is a **concrete method** on `BaseAdapter` that dispatches to all four encoders (`prompt`, `images`, `videos`, `audios`) and skips integration when the called encoder returns `None`. It does NOT need to be overridden unless the model requires cross-modal preprocessing (e.g. prompt rewriting from images).

Breaking the signature of any of the four abstract methods (or changing the encoder return contract from "dict-or-`None`") breaks the entire training pipeline.

**Adapter hierarchy**: All model adapters MUST inherit directly from `BaseAdapter` — never from another adapter. Shared logic between adapters for the same model family should use private helper functions, code duplication, or mixins — not adapter-to-adapter inheritance. Adapter subclassing creates fragile coupling where changes to a parent adapter silently break child adapters, and makes the 4-abstract-method contract harder to verify (the 4 per-modality encoders have no-op defaults, so a fresh subclass of `BaseAdapter` is always valid; chained inheritance hides which encoder a model actually overrides).

### 13. BaseRewardModel Paradigm Split
- `PointwiseRewardModel.__call__` receives batches of size `batch_size`, returns rewards of shape `(batch_size,)`
- `GroupwiseRewardModel.__call__` receives all samples in a group (size `group_size`), returns rewards of shape `(group_size,)`

The `RewardProcessor` dispatches differently based on the model type. Do not change the calling convention.

### 14. Sample Dataclass Hierarchy
`BaseSample` → `T2ISample`, `ImageConditionSample`, `T2VSample`, `T2AVSample`, etc. The `_shared_fields` class variable determines which fields are NOT stacked across a batch. Incorrect `_shared_fields` causes silent data corruption during collation.

**Two-layer hierarchy**: Task-level samples (`T2ISample`, `I2VSample`, `I2AVSample`, ...) are defined in `samples/samples.py` and inherit from `BaseSample` or its condition mixins (`ImageConditionSample`, `VideoConditionSample`). Model-specific samples (`LTX2Sample`, `LTX2I2AVSample`, ...) MUST inherit from the appropriate task-level sample — never from another model-specific sample across files. This mirrors the flat adapter hierarchy: `LTX2I2AVSample(I2AVSample)`, NOT `LTX2I2AVSample(LTX2Sample)`.

---

## Configuration System (15–17)

### 15. Pydantic Hparams Synchronization
All config dataclasses live in `hparams/`. The top-level `Arguments` aggregates `DataArguments`, `ModelArguments`, `TrainingArguments`, `RewardArguments`, `LogArguments`, etc. Field changes MUST be reflected in:
1. The dataclass definition
2. ALL YAML configs under `examples/` (renames/removals: search-replace; new user-facing fields: add with defaults and `# Options:` comments)
3. Any code that accesses `config.<field_name>`

### 16. Algorithm-Specific Training Args
`TrainingArguments` has algorithm-specific subclasses (`GRPOTrainingArguments`, `DPPOTrainingArguments`, `DPOTrainingArguments`, `DGPOTrainingArguments`, `NFTTrainingArguments`, `AWMTrainingArguments`, `CRDTrainingArguments`, `DiffusionOPDTrainingArguments`). The correct subclass is resolved by `get_training_args_class()` (registry in `hparams/training_args/_registry.py`). Adding a new algorithm requires adding a corresponding subclass and updating the resolver.

### 17. YAML Config Structure
Config keys must exactly match Pydantic field names. Typos fail silently with default values. See `examples/` for canonical config templates; structure defined in `hparams/args.py`.

---

## Distributed Training (18–20)

### 18. All-Rank Synchronization Points
`accelerator.wait_for_everyone()` must be called at critical synchronization points (after preprocessing, before/after evaluation, checkpoint saving). Missing barriers cause deadlocks or race conditions.

### 19. FSDP CPU Efficient Loading
When using FSDP with CPU offloading, frozen components (text encoder, VAE) may be uninitialized on Rank > 0. The `_synchronize_frozen_components()` method handles this. Do not remove or bypass it.

### 20. Mixed Precision Consistency
The adapter sets inference dtype for frozen components and training dtype for trainable parameters in `_mix_precision()`. Autocast context is configured in `BaseTrainer.__init__`. Do not manually cast tensors unless you understand the precision boundary. Details: `topics/dtype_precision.md`.

---

## Code Quality (21–27)

### 21. Formatting Standards
- **Black** with `line-length=100`, targeting Python 3.10–3.12
- **isort** with `profile="black"`, `line_length=100`
- Comments and docstrings in **English**

### 22. Import Style
- Use relative imports within `flow_factory` package (e.g., `from ..hparams import *`)
- Use absolute imports for external packages
- Follow existing wildcard import patterns for `hparams`
- **Top-level imports only**: All `import` / `from ... import ...` statements MUST live at the top of the module, never inside function bodies, methods, `__init__`, or conditional branches. Sanctioned exceptions: (a) optional dependencies wrapped in `try/except ImportError` (e.g., `deepspeed`, `xformers`); (b) backend-gated imports where the target symbol is only resolvable under a specific runtime backend already selected by a preceding feature check (e.g., DeepSpeed/FSDP submodules guarded by `is_deepspeed()` / `is_fsdp2()` in `models/abc.py`); (c) genuine unresolvable circular imports documented inline. Lazy imports added merely for "import speed" or "to keep the module light" are NOT acceptable — every hard dependency already runs through Python's import machinery on a typical import path. Inline imports hide the dependency surface from readers, `isort`, and static-analysis tools, and re-execute on every call in hot loops.

### 23. Type Annotations
All public methods must have type annotations. Use `typing` module types (`List`, `Dict`, `Optional`, `Tuple`, `Union`) for Python 3.10 compatibility.

### 24. License Header
All source files must include the Apache 2.0 license header with `Copyright 2026 Jayce-Ping`.

### 25. Logger Message Style
Logger messages referencing config parameters MUST use user-facing field names (not shorthand like `M`, `K`, `W`), show concrete values in parentheses (e.g., `unique_sample_num_per_epoch(32)`), and structure multi-constraint messages with numbered lines.

### 26. Fail-Fast Error Handling
Raise exceptions with detailed debug information over silent auto-fallback. Do not add defensive fallback code that silently recovers from invalid inputs. Auto-fallback is only acceptable when documented as intentional design. Details: `.cursor/rules/no-defensive-except.mdc`.

### 27. Docstring Style
All public functions and methods must have Google-style docstrings in English: imperative one-liner summary, `Args:`, `Returns:`, optional `Note:`. Private helpers (`_func`) may use a one-liner docstring if the behavior is obvious.

### 28. Agent Scratch Files
When an agent (sub-agent, background agent, or any automated tool) needs to write temporary files — investigation reports, analysis documents, checklists, diagrams, or any intermediate artifact that is NOT part of the final deliverable — it MUST write them under the `.scratch/` directory at the repository root. **Never** write temporary files to the project root or any tracked directory (`src/`, `guidance/`, `.agents/`, `.docs/`, `examples/`). `.scratch/` is git-ignored, so files there will not pollute the working tree or accidentally get staged.

### 29. Examples Directory Convention
Example configs follow the path convention `examples/{algorithm}/{finetune_type}/{model_type}/{variant}.yaml`. Model directory names use underscores matching the config `model_type` field (e.g., `sd3_5`, `flux1_kontext`). The baseline config for a model is `default.yaml`. When adding, renaming, or removing examples, update all path references in `README.md`, `guidance/*.md`, and `examples/README.md`.
